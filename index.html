                            Most people haven’t heard of X.com, one of the first online banks, founded by Musk.
                            But they probably have heard of the online payment system PayPal.<br><br>
                            X.com merged with Confinity in 2000 before becoming PayPal — which eBay bought in 2002 for $1.5 billion.

                        While the COVID-19 pandemic shattered the global economy in 2020 and put millions of people out
                        of work, Tesla’s stock price increased 700%, adding $140 billion to Musk’s net worth.Musk, CEO of Tesla,
                        was an early investor in the company that since became the king of the electric vehicle (EV) industry.

                        But Tesla soon may face serious competition from Volkswagen, which has jumped full force into the EV

                        In a 58-page technical paper from 2013, Musk outlined his vision for a mode of transportation that could 
                        achieve high speeds using a hovering pod that travels without friction or air resistance through a tubed 
                        system.<br><br>
                        He never turned the idea into a company, but Virgin Hyperloop grabbed the ball in 2014 and ran with it. 
                        <br><br>
                        On Nov. 8, 2020, the company’s experimental two-seater made a successful test run in the Nevada desert.

                        launched Open AI, a nonprofit and open-source artificial intelligence research company. <br><br>
                        The three had worked together in the early days of PayPal.In a 2014 interview at M.I.T., Musk described 
                        artificial intelligence as our “biggest existential threat,” according to The New York Times.<br><br>
                        The aim of the new organization was to develop artificial intelligence in a way that would have a positive 
                        effect on humanity, Musk told The Times.

                        Musk launched Neuralink, a neurotechnology company, in 2016. His aim was to create brain-machine interfaces 
                        linking living brains to human-made technology.<br><br>
                        The company says its initial goal is “to help people with paralysis to regain independence through the control 
                        of computers and mobile devices.”Neuralink hopes its technology might eventually be able to “treat a wide range 
                        of neurological disorders, to restore sensory and movement function.”
